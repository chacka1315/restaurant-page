# Restaurant Page
A single-page restaurant website built with Vanilla JavaScript as part of the JavaScript curriculum of The Odin Project.
This project introduced me to modern JavaScript development concepts, including module bundling, Webpack, and project structuring.

# 🚀 Overview
The Restaurant Page project creates a dynamic web page for a fictional restaurant.
Users can switch between sections like Home, Menu, and Contact without refreshing the page, demonstrating DOM manipulation and modular JavaScript architecture.
## Key learning objectives:
- Build a modular project with ES6 modules
- Use Webpack to bundle assets for the browser
- Understand project organization and separation of concerns

# ✨ Features
- Interactive single-page layout (Home, Menu, Contact)
- Dynamic content rendering using JavaScript modules
- Styled layout with CSS
- Bundled assets using Webpack for production readiness

# 🧠 Challenges & Learnings
This project was my first experience with Webpack and module bundling. I learned how to:
- split code into reusable modules
- bundle assets for efficient browser loading
- organize a project for scalability and maintainability
- dynamically render page content without page reloads


# 🏁 Conclusion
The Restaurant Page project helped me understand module bundling, Webpack, and modular JavaScript. It strengthened my ability to organize and structure code for more complex projects, preparing me for full-stack development.
